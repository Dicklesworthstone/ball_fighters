## Game Overview

In Ball Fighters, two players control balls on a grid, aiming to cover as many squares as possible with their respective colors. The game incorporates unique mechanics like speed boosts and control influence, making it a challenging and engaging experience.

## Features

- **Dual-Player Gameplay**: Two players compete against each other, each controlling their own ball on the canvas.
- **Interactive Control**: Players use keyboard inputs to move their balls across the grid.
- **Speed Boost Mechanism**: Players can activate a temporary speed boost, increasing the ball's velocity.
- **Dynamic Game Charts**: Real-time charts display various game metrics, including velocity, acceleration, score differential, and control influence.

## Controls

- **Player 1**:
  - Movement: Arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right)
  - Speed Boost: Right Shift key
- **Player 2**:
  - Movement: 'W', 'A', 'S', 'D' keys
  - Speed Boost: Left Shift key

## Mechanics

- **Movement**: Players can move their balls in four directions. The path of the ball changes based on the player's continuous input.
- **Speed Boost**: When the shift key is pressed, the ball's speed increases. However, this comes at the cost of reduced control, making it challenging to change directions swiftly.
- **Scoring**: The objective is to cover as many squares as possible with your color. The game tracks each player's coverage.
- **Control Influence**: This metric shows how much players have altered their ball's velocity from its natural path, offering insights into gameplay style.

## Game Charts

- **Velocity Chart**: Displays the real-time velocity of each player's ball.
- **Acceleration Chart**: Shows changes in acceleration, highlighting dynamic movements and speed boosts.
- **Score Chart**: Tracks the score differential between the two players over time.
- **Control Chart**: Visualizes the control influence, representing the degree of deviation from the natural ball trajectory.
